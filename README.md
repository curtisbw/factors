# Factors

This repository contains portfolio specifications to generate
factor return streams.

See the [factor-coefficients](https://portfoliotree.com/docs#factor-coefficients)
section to get an idea of what these return streams are used for.

The specs here are not the ones we use on the site; however, in the future these specs will be the source of truth for what the factors are.
